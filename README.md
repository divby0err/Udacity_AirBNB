# Analysis of Seattle airbnb Data


## Installations

To run the project you should ue jupyter notebooks. A number of Python libraries are required, including Numpy, Padas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and various models and functions from sklearn.


## Project Motivation

I carried out this project for an assignment in the Udacity Nanodegree program.
The objective was to pick a data set and analyse it to answer three defined business questions.
I decided to use the suggested airbnb dataset containing listings for Seattle (in 2016).

The three business questions I aim to answer are:

Concerning airbnb rental listings in Seattle (as of April 2016)

1. How does the neighbourhood of the property affect the price?
2. How does the property type affect the price?
3. How effectively can I predict the price of a listing using a machine learning model?


## File Descriptions

* Seattle_airbnb.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing my analysis
* calendar.csv : availability of each listing per day
* listings.csv: full descriptions of properties listed for rental on airbnb
* reviews.csv: reviews for each listing

The three csv data files were sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data.
More detail can be sourced there.



## Interacting With The Project

The Notebook is self-contained, provided you have Python and Jupyter notebooks you should be able to load the ipynb file and run all cells.  The data files need to be saved in a "Seattle" sub-folder for the import commands to work.
